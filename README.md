# Colorado Election Results Analysis

## Overview of the project 

This is an analysis of the Colorado election results for the election commission. The analysis is looking into a number of specific outputs as well as a business proposal for the election commission regarding potentially using this script (with modifications) for any election. The analysis also looks into the data limitations and provides suggestions for future data improvements.
